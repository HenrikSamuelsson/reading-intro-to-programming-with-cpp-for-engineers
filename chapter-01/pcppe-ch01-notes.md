# Notes Chapter 1

The book is about programming computers with the C++ programming language.

The author Boguslaw Cyganek is from Poland and has experience in teaching computer science and C++ programming at university level.

Knowing C++ enables working in programming with systems programming and other areas where performance is key.

Some benefits of C++:

- High performance due to that this is a design philosophy of C++
- Possible to do both system low-level and high level object-oriented programming in C++
- Strongly typed language making it possible to eliminate errors early at compile time
- Good support for input-output
- Move semantics in modern C++ gives good performance due to that copying of objects is not needed
- Lambda expressions results in elegant code and increased productivity
